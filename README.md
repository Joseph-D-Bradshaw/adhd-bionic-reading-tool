# ADHD Reading Tool

This is a quick bionic reading tool that allows one to copy/paste text into a field and have
x amount of the first letters in each word be highlighted bold.

This can then simply be saved as a html or PDF document to make it easier to read long, 
boring text for those with trouble focusing due to ADHD.
